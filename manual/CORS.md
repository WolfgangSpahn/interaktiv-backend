## CORS Setup

The **heavy lifting for CORS** is done entirely on the **backend (AWS) side** using **Nginx** (or Flask if necessary). The frontend simply makes requests to the **absolute URL** of the backend (`https://sebayt.ch/interaktiv/...`), and the backend is responsible for handling the CORS headers properly.

### Breakdown of How It Works:

1. **Frontend (Localhost or GitHub Pages)**:
   - The frontend just issues HTTP requests (e.g., using `fetch`) to an **absolute URL** like `https://sebayt.ch/interaktiv/ipsocket` regardless of where the frontend is hosted.
   - Whether the frontend is running on `localhost` (during development) or on `GitHub Pages` (in production), the browser sends the request to the backend along with the `Origin` header indicating the origin of the request.

2. **Backend (AWS)**:
   - **Nginx** on the backend dynamically processes the CORS headers.
   - When a request arrives at the backend, Nginx looks at the **`Origin` header** sent by the browser. Based on that, Nginx responds with the correct **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`** header (either `https://localhost:4443` for local development or `https://wolfgang-spahn.github.io` for production).
   - The backend also handles **preflight `OPTIONS` requests** (required for `POST` requests or custom headers), ensuring the correct CORS behavior.

### Responsibilities:

- **Frontend**:
  - Just issues HTTP requests to the absolute URL (`https://sebayt.ch/interaktiv/...`).
  - No need to worry about handling CORS at the frontendâ€”just ensure that the `Origin` header is correctly sent by the browser (which happens automatically).

- **Backend (AWS with Nginx)**:
  - Dynamically handles the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header based on the `Origin` of the incoming request.
  - Ensures that only one origin is allowed per request, avoiding CORS issues.
  - Handles preflight requests and other CORS-related headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, etc.

### Frontend Example:

```javascript
// Base URL of the backend API
const BASE_URL = 'https://sebayt.ch/interaktiv';

// Example function to fetch data from the backend
export async function doFetch(url, method, data = null, callback = null) {
    const fetchOptions = {
        method: method,
        headers: {},
    };

    if (data && ['POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH'].includes(method.toUpperCase())) {
        fetchOptions.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json';
        fetchOptions.body = JSON.stringify(data);
    }

    const fetchUrl = url.startsWith('http') ? url : `${BASE_URL}/${url}`;

    try {
        const response = await fetch(fetchUrl, fetchOptions);
        if (!response.ok) {
            console.error(`Error: ${response.statusText}`);
            return null;
        }
        const responseData = await response.json();
        if (callback) callback(responseData);
        return responseData;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Fetch error:', error);
        return null;
    }
}
```

### How Requests Work:
- When running locally (`https://localhost:4443`), your frontend makes requests to `https://sebayt.ch/interaktiv/...`, and the backend (via Nginx) returns `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://localhost:4443`.
- When the frontend is deployed to GitHub Pages (`https://wolfgang-spahn.github.io`), it makes the same requests, but the backend will now return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://wolfgang-spahn.github.io`.

### Conclusion:
The **frontend** is kept simple, just making requests to the backend. The **backend** does all the complex work, dynamically handling CORS and ensuring correct headers are returned based on where the request is coming from.


# CORS preflight requests

The automatic handling of the `OPTIONS` request in your Flask application is being managed by **`Flask-CORS`**, not because of the `methods` parameter in the route.

### Here's the Explanation:

- **`CORS(app)`**: When you initialize Flask-CORS using `CORS(app)`, it automatically adds the necessary CORS headers and also handles **preflight `OPTIONS` requests** for routes that include methods like `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`. Flask-CORS ensures that these `OPTIONS` requests return the appropriate CORS headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.
  
- **Automatic `OPTIONS` Handling by Flask-CORS**: When you enable CORS via `Flask-CORS`, the library takes care of responding to **CORS preflight requests** (which are `OPTIONS` requests) without the need to explicitly define the `OPTIONS` method in your Flask routes.

- **No Explicit `OPTIONS` Definition Needed**: This means that you don't need to manually define the `OPTIONS` method in your route with `methods=['OPTIONS']`, because `Flask-CORS` automatically intercepts `OPTIONS` requests and returns the necessary CORS headers.

### What's Happening in Your Case:

1. **When you exclude `OPTIONS` from the route**: 
   If you do not include `OPTIONS` in the `methods` parameter, Flask itself doesn't automatically create an `OPTIONS` handler. However, **`Flask-CORS`** does handle this behind the scenes. That's why when you make an `OPTIONS` request, you still receive the correct headers but no content.

2. **The Response You See**: 
   You correctly observed that the response to the `OPTIONS` request contains CORS headers but no content. This is the intended behavior of a CORS preflight request:
   - **HTTP 200 OK** with appropriate headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, etc.) but without any content (`content-length: 0`).
   
### Simplified Example of How `Flask-CORS` Works:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)

# Enabling CORS for the whole app, which handles OPTIONS requests automatically
CORS(app)

@app.route('/example', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def example():
    return jsonify(message="This is a response"), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```

### What Happens Here:

- **CORS Preflight Requests**: `Flask-CORS` automatically adds the necessary CORS headers for preflight requests (`OPTIONS`) and returns a response without any content, just headers. You do not need to add `OPTIONS` to the `methods` argument of the route.
  
- **Actual Requests**: When the browser sends the actual request (e.g., `GET` or `POST`), Flask handles it as usual and returns the response body (`message: "This is a response"`).

### Key Takeaways:

- **`Flask-CORS` Handles `OPTIONS` Requests Automatically**: When you use `CORS(app)`, it automatically adds CORS headers and handles preflight `OPTIONS` requests for routes that require them, such as `POST` or `PUT`. You don't need to manually define `OPTIONS` in your routes.
  
- **CORS Preflight Behavior**: The `OPTIONS` preflight request returns only headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, etc.) without content, which is what you're seeing.

### Conclusion:

Your observation is correct: the `OPTIONS` request handling you're seeing is managed by **`Flask-CORS`**. It ensures that CORS preflight requests are automatically responded to with the correct headers, without needing explicit handling in your routes. This is exactly what you should expect with `Flask-CORS`.
